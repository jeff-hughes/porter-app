    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The online version of this family history was first generated by scanning in the typewritten version, and using optical character recognition (OCR) &ndash; via <a href="https://github.com/kyper999/pyocr">pyocr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a> &ndash; to convert the typed pages into plain text. (The pages were first converted from PDF to jpeg images using the <a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Python Image Library, or Pillow</a>.) This resulted in mostly usable text, but still required fairly significant manual cleaning to correct errors.</p>

    <p>Creating a script to properly parse all of the details in the text proved challenging, and ultimately the text was manually inputted into three CSV files, designating <em>people</em>, <em>children</em>, and <em>marriages</em>. From there, it was ready to be inserted into the database.</p>

    <p>The data is stored in a <a href="https://neo4j.com/">neo4j</a> database, a graph database that allows for sophisticated ways to navigate relationships between data points. Given that a family tree constitutes a graph of nodes and edges, neo4j seemed like a natural fit. (Note that, for this relatively small amount of data, the choice of database is inconsequential; I also just wanted a chance to play around with a graph database.) The database is then accessed via the <a href="https://py2neo.org/2020.1/">py2neo</a> package, which provides a Python toolkit for accessing neo4j databases.</p>

    <p>The app itself uses <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, a Python web framework, and both the Flask app and the database are set up in <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers for easier maintenance and dependency management.</p>

    <p>Code for the app is available on <a href="https://github.com/jeff-hughes/porter-app">Github</a>.</p>
