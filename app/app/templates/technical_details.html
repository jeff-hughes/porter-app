    <h2>Notes and Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The online version of this family history was first generated by scanning in the typewritten version, and using optical character recognition (OCR) &ndash; via <a href="https://github.com/kyper999/pyocr">pyocr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a> &ndash; to convert the typed pages into plain text. (The pages were first converted from PDF to jpeg images using the <a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Python Image Library, or Pillow</a>.) This resulted in mostly usable text, but still required fairly significant manual cleaning to correct errors.</p>

    <p>Creating a script to properly parse all of the details in the text proved challenging, and ultimately the text was manually inputted into three CSV files, designating <em>people</em>, <em>children</em>, and <em>marriages</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Note that during this process, gender was added as an additional piece of information for each person. However, adding this information involved making some assumptions. First, while many names are largely masculine or feminine, in some cases a gender-neutral name meant that I had to guess a person&rsquo;s gender based on the name of their spouse, which may have led to inaccuracies. Second, in all cases, the assumption is that individuals identify with the gender associated with their birth name, which may not always be the case. Individuals may be transgender, non-binary, or otherwise not self-identify with the gender that is stated here. (If you are aware of any inaccuracies in this regard, <a href="{{ url_for('report') }}">please let me know</a> and I am happy to correct it.) Gender can have such a large role to play in people&rsquo;s lives, so it felt important to include here; but it is important to keep the assumptions about this data in mind.</p>

    <p>After creating the CSV files, the data was inputted into a <a href="https://neo4j.com/">neo4j</a> database, a graph database that allows for sophisticated ways to navigate relationships between data points. Given that a family tree constitutes a graph of nodes and edges, neo4j seemed like a natural fit. (Note that, for this relatively small amount of data, the choice of database is inconsequential; I also just wanted a chance to play around with a graph database.) The database is then accessed via the <a href="https://py2neo.org/2020.1/">py2neo</a> package, which provides a Python toolkit for accessing neo4j databases.</p>

    <p>The app itself uses <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, a Python web framework, and both the Flask app and the database are set up in <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers for easier maintenance and dependency management.</p>

    <p>Code for the app is available on <a href="https://github.com/jeff-hughes/porter-app">Github</a>.</p>
