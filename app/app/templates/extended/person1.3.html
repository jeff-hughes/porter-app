    <p><a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.3a') }}">George Henry Arthur</a> was the son of John Arthur, Sr., a farmer and a Justice of the Peace, according to the Biographical Directory of Grey County Subscribers in the <u>Historical Atlas of Grey and Bruce Counties, 1880</u> (H. Belden and Co., Publishers). John Arthur was born in County Tyrone, Ireland in 1803 and settled in Grey County in 1859. He owned Lots 20 and 21, Concession 9 of St. Vincent Township at a value of $10,000 for 200 acres.</p>

    <p>George Henry Arthur bought 100 acres, Lot 20, Concession 10 (the south half of the lot) in 1866 from his father. In the Historical Atlas, this property was valued at $6,000 in 1880.</p>
    
    <p>George and Sarah Jane Arthur later moved to Lot 17, Concession 11 of St. Vincent Township. He purchased 100 acres (the south half of the lot) in 1888 from Nathan Seaman. This farm was known as Fairview Grange. The date of their move is not exactly known, although it may have been in 1889. The reason for my guess is that George Arthur was a ratepayer of S.S. #12 (known as Street&rsquo;s School or Bumstead&rsquo;s School) in 1889. He was also a ratepayer of S.S. #11
    (St. John&rsquo;s School) in 1889. All their children attended one or both schools. <a href="#note1">(Note 1)</a></p>
    
    <p>On Fairview Grange (Lot 17, Concession 11) is a beautiful stone house which still stands as a sentinel on the hill, overlooking the countryside facing the town of Meaford. This house was built in 1867. The original barn was destroyed by fire in the 1960s and a new one has been built.</p>
    
    <p>George Henry Arthur sold Lot 20, Concession 10 to his son <a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.3.9') }}">Orville J. Arthur</a> in 1910. Orville sold it to his brother <a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.3.8') }}">George Frederick</a> in 1912. George Frederick later sold it to John W. Jolley in 1920. This farm (Lot 20, Concession 10) was in the George Henry Arthur family name for 54 years. The house on this farm was destroyed by fire in the 1960s.</p>
    
    <p>In 1911, George Henry Arthur sold Lot 17, Concession 11 to two of his sons&mdash;the west or back half (50 acres) to <a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.3.8') }}">George Frederick Arthur</a>, the east or front half (50 acres) to <a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.3.5') }}">Bernard Stanley Arthur</a>. In 1912 George F. Arthur sold his part of the farm to Bernard Arthur. Bernard owned the whole farm until 1948 when he and his son sold it to Frederick I. Genoe, who in turn sold it in 1949 to Clarence Whitfield. This farm (Lot 17, Concession 11) was in the Arthur family name for 60 years.</p>
    
    <p>In the 1871 St. Vincent Township census George Henry Arthur and Sarah Jane Arthur are listed in the following way.</p>
    
    <blockquote><p>George Henry Arthur age 32, Wesleyan Methodist, Irish descent, a farmer<br />
    Sarah Jane Arthur age 20, English descent<br />
