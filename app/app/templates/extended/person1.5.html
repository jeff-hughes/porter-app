    <p>The Atkins farm was located at Lot 26, Concession 9 of St. Vincent Township, part of the Irish Mountain. This was where <a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.5a') }}">Levi Atkins</a> grew up with his parents, Joseph and Ellen Atkins. Joseph Atkins purchased 100 acres, the south half of the lot, from the Crown, then willed it to his son Levi in 1900. Levi sold the farm to his daughter and son-in-law, <a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.5.2') }}">Hattie</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('person_page', pid='1.5.2a') }}">Frederick G. Ellis</a> in 1926, with the condition that they would be joint tenants with a bedroom reserved for him in the house. In 1942 this farm became the property of the Meaford Tank Range, so it is now inaccessible. (To see a picture of the house on this farm, see page 85 of <u>History of The Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, 1847-1967</u>.) Mr. and Mrs. Ellis moved to Meaford when they sold the farm.</p>
